# Red Hat Decision Manager Setup

This repository contains scripts to install Decision Central and Server as separate instances on standalone JBoss EAP deployments.

After the setup is complete and Decision Manager is running, a quickstart/example application can be imported from https://github.com/juliaaano/rhdm-eap-start.
